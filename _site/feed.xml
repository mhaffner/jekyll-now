I’m
doing this for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;1-ease-of-creatingpublishing-posts&quot;&gt;(1) Ease of creating/publishing posts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my first few Wordpress posts I typed content directly in Wordpress.
I didn’t mind this at the time, but eventually I started using Emacs
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;org-mode&lt;/code&gt; for all writing, including research papers, blog posts,
etc. After a semi-debacle of copying an html-exported &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;org&lt;/code&gt; file into
Wordpress, I never posted again. This manual labor approach did not
appeal to me. I discovered that I could host a blog through GitHub
pages and simply push a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt; file to a repository (much like I was
already doing with code repositories) to create a post. This is much,
much easier than what I was doing with Wordpress before. I’m still in
the process of figuring out how to use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;org-mode&lt;/code&gt; on here, but I’ll be
there soon :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;2-version-control&quot;&gt;(2) Version control&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have the unfortunate habit of nuking everying I do pretty regularly,
and git makes me forgive myself exceedingly quicker than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;3-less-corporate-controlprofitwhatever&quot;&gt;(3) Less corporate control/profit/whatever&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more ads. More control for me. No longer do I get sick when I accidentally
see options to &lt;em&gt;pay&lt;/em&gt; for Wordpress themes thinking about all the innocent people
who have willingly done this (now that I know about Jekyll). &lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt; So I found
out that there are plenty of Jekyll themes you can pay for too. But I can still
avoid seeing this easier on GitHub pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;4-easier-to-reflect-changes-to-my-cv&quot;&gt;(4) Easier to reflect changes to my CV&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing wrong with a little self-promotion on a personal blog, right? With
Wordpress I had to upload my new CV through the web interface &lt;em&gt;every time&lt;/em&gt; I
made a change (which is quite often). I’m still working on this, but I plan on
creating a symbolic link from my CV repository here, so all I’ll have to do is
push the changes to this repository when I update my CV.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’m currently in the process of moving my blog to GitHub pages. I’m doing this for several reasons:</summary></entry></feed>
