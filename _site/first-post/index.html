  <h1>The Burnination of the Wordpress</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>I’m currently in the process of moving my blog to GitHub pages. I’m
doing this for several reasons:</p>

<h1 id="1-ease-of-creatingpublishing-posts">(1) Ease of creating/publishing posts</h1>
<p>On my first few Wordpress posts I typed content directly in Wordpress.
I didn’t mind this at the time, but eventually I started using Emacs
<code class="highlighter-rouge">org-mode</code> for all writing, including research papers, blog posts,
etc. After a semi-debacle of copying an html-exported <code class="highlighter-rouge">org</code> file into
Wordpress, I never posted again. This manual labor approach did not
appeal to me. I discovered that I could host a blog through GitHub
pages and simply push a <code class="highlighter-rouge">.md</code> file to a repository (much like I was
already doing with code repositories) to create a post. This is much,
much easier than what I was doing with Wordpress before. I’m still in
the process of figuring out how to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">org-mode</code> on here, but I’ll be
there soon :)</p>

<h1 id="2-version-control">(2) Version control</h1>
<p>I have the unfortunate habit of nuking everying I do pretty regularly,
and git makes me forgive myself exceedingly quicker than before.</p>

<h1 id="3-less-corporate-controlprofitwhatever">(3) Less corporate control/profit/whatever</h1>
<p>No more ads. More control for me. No longer do I get sick when I accidentally
see options to <em>pay</em> for Wordpress themes thinking about all the innocent people
who have willingly done this (now that I know about Jekyll). <strong>EDIT</strong> So I found
out that there are plenty of Jekyll themes you can pay for too. But I can still
avoid seeing this easier on GitHub pages.</p>

<h1 id="4-easier-to-reflect-changes-to-my-cv">(4) Easier to reflect changes to my CV</h1>
<p>Nothing wrong with a little self-promotion on a personal blog, right? With
Wordpress I had to upload my new CV through the web interface <em>every time</em> I
made a change (which is quite often). I’m still working on this, but I plan on
creating a symbolic link from my CV repository here, so all I’ll have to do is
push the changes to this repository when I update my CV.</p>
